# GeneticAlgorithm
This is a project I made to demonstrate a genetic algorithm in python. This project simulates different generation of turtles, whose goal is to get away from the center as quickly as possible. At first the turtles have random genes, causing them to move around the center mostly. Here is an example picture of the turtles after the first generationi

They don't really move too far. After some breeding and dropping out of the worst turtles, after several generations, we get turtles that are moving away from the middle.

In order to run this program, simply run 
```
python evolve.py
```
